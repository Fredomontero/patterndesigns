        <h2>Constructor pattern</h2>
        <p>
            A constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object once memory has been allocated for it. In javascript as almost everything is an object
            we're most often interested in object constructors.
            Object constructors ar eused to create specific types of objects - both preparing the object for use and accepting arguments which a constructor can use to set the values of
            member properties and methods when the object is first created.

            <h2>Constructor with prototypes Pattern</h2>
            <p>
                When an object is created, its definition is inherited froma  prototype. Weirdly, each prototype is also an object, so even prototypes  have prototypes. Except 
                for object, which is the top-level prototype. The advantage to attaching functions to the prototypes is that only a single copy of the function is created; saving
                on memory.
